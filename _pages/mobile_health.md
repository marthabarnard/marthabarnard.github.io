### Statistical and machine learning methods for mobile health data
Mobile apps and wearable devices accurately and continuously measure human activity; patterns within this data can provide a wealth of information applicable to fields such as transportation and health. Despite the potential utility of this data, the intensively sampled nature of the data makes it difficult to accomodate the richness of the data without substantially increasing model and/or computational complexity. To adress these challenges, we have proposed a novel clustering method and cluster evaluation metric for human activity data that leverages an adjacency matrix representation to cluster the data without the calculation of a distance matrix. This technique is substantially faster than conventional methods based on computing pairwise distances via sequence alignment algorithms and also enhances interpretability of results. See the corresponding paper for this work [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2025.2506196). Furthmore, we are currently working on developing causal inference techniques for functional treatments such that we can explore, for example, how increasing physical activity trajectories in the afternoon impacts human health outcomes.
