Hi, my name is Martha Barnard and I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Minnesota, Division of Biostatistics and Health Data Science. My research interests include clustering and machine learning, statistical methods for mobile health data, and causal inference. Previously, I was a post-bachelor research and Los Alamos National Lab working on infectious disease modeling. I graduated with B.A. in Mathematics from St. Olaf College in 2021.
**I am on the academic job market in 2025-2026**.
