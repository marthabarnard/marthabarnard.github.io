### Causal effect estimation under positivity violations
Estimating the causal effect of a binary treatment or health policy with observational data can be challenging due to an imbalance of and a lack of overlap between treated and control covariate distributions. In the presence of limited overlap, researchers choose between 1) methods (e.g., inverse probability weighting) that imply traditional estimands but whose estimators are at risk of considerable bias and variance; and 2) methods (e.g., overlap weighting) which imply a different estimand, thereby modifying the target population to reduce variance. We bridge the gap between these methods by proposing a framework for navigating the tradeoffs between variance and bias due to imbalance and lack of overlap and the targeting of the estimand of scientific interest. This procedure allows analysts to incorporate their domain-specific preference for preservation of the original research population versus reduction of statistical bias when identifying an estimand in scenarios with a lack of overlap. See the corresponding paper for this work [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12093). As an extension of this work, we are currently developing direct balancing weighting methods that yield a solution when there is a lack of overlap by targeting a different population for a subset of covariates.
