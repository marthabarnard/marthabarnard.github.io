	abstract = {Background: Health authorities can minimize the impact of an emergent infectious disease outbreak through effective and timely risk communication, which can build trust and adherence to subsequent behavioral messaging. Monitoring the psychological impacts of an outbreak, as well as public adherence to such messaging, is also important for minimizing long-term effects of an outbreak.
Objective: We used social media data from Twitter to identify human behaviors relevant to COVID-19 transmission, as well as the perceived impacts of COVID-19 on individuals, as a first step toward real-time monitoring of public perceptions to inform public health communications.
Methods: We developed a coding schema for 6 categories and 11 subcategories, which included both a wide number of behaviors as well codes focused on the impacts of the pandemic (eg, economic and mental health impacts). We used this to develop training data and develop supervised learning classifiers for classes with sufficient labels. Classifiers that performed adequately were applied to our remaining corpus, and temporal and geospatial trends were assessed. We compared the classified patterns to ground truth mobility data and actual COVID-19 confirmed cases to assess the signal achieved here.
Results: We applied our labeling schema to approximately 7200 tweets. The worst-performing classifiers had F1 scores of only 0.18 to 0.28 when trying to identify tweets about monitoring symptoms and testing. Classifiers about social distancing, however, were much stronger, with F1 scores of 0.64 to 0.66.  We applied the social distancing classifiers to over 228 million tweets. We showed temporal patterns consistent with real-world events, and we showed correlations of up to –0.5 between social distancing signals on Twitter and ground truth mobility throughout the United States.
Conclusions: Behaviors discussed on Twitter are exceptionally varied. Twitter can provide useful information for parameterizing models that incorporate human behavior, as well as for informing public health communication strategies by describing awareness of and compliance with suggested behaviors.},

	abstract = {Seasonal influenza is a sometimes surprisingly impactful disease, causing thousands of deaths per year along with much additional morbidity. Timely knowledge of the outbreak state is valuable for managing an effective response. The current state of the art is to gather this knowledge using in-person patient contact. While accurate, this is time-consuming and expensive. This has motivated inquiry into new approaches using internet activity traces, based on the theory that lay observations of health status lead to informative features in internet data. These approaches risk being deceived by activity traces having a coincidental, rather than informative, relationship to disease incidence; to our knowledge, this risk has not yet been quantitatively explored. We evaluated both simulated and real activity traces of varying deceptiveness for influenza incidence estimation using linear regression. We found that deceptiveness knowledge does reduce error in such estimates, that it may help automatically-selected features perform as well or better than features that require human curation, and that a semantic distance measure derived from the Wikipedia article category tree serves as a useful proxy for deceptiveness. This suggests that disease incidence estimation models should incorporate not only data about how internet features map to incidence but also additional data to estimate feature deceptiveness. By doing so, we may gain one more step along the path to accurate, reliable disease incidence estimation using internet data. This capability would improve public health by decreasing the cost and increasing the timeliness of such estimates.},

	abstract = {As temperatures change worldwide, the pattern and competency of disease vectors will change, altering the global distribution of both the burden of infectious disease and the risk of the emergence of those diseases into new regions. To evaluate the risk of potential summer dengue outbreaks triggered by infected travelers under various climate scenarios, we develop an SEIR-type model, run numerical simulations, and conduct sensitivity analyses under a range of temperature profiles. Our model extends existing theoretical frameworks for studying dengue dynamics by introducing temperature dependence of two key parameters: the mosquito extrinsic incubation period and the lifespan of mosquitoes, which empirical data suggests are both highly temperature dependent. We find that changing temperature significantly alters dengue risk in an inverted U-shape, with temperatures in the range 27-31°C producing the highest risk. As temperatures increase beyond 31°C, the determinants of dengue risk begin to shift from mosquito biting rate and carrying capacity to the duration of the human infectious period, suggesting that changing temperatures not only alter dengue risk but also the potential efficacy of control measures. To illustrate the role of spatial and temporal temperature heterogeneity, we select five US cities where the primary dengue vector, the mosquito Aedes aegypti, has been observed, and which have had dengue cases in the past: Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, Brownsville, and Phoenix. Our analysis suggests that an increase of 3°C leads to an approximate doubling of the risk of dengue in Los Angeles and Houston, but a reduction of risk in Miami, Brownsville, and Phoenix due to extreme heat.},

A comprehensive characterization of vulnerability can inform efforts to improve infrastructure and guide disaster response in the future. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework for studying countries’ vulnerability and resilience to incident disasters across multiple dimensions of society. To illustrate this methodology, we leverage the rich data landscape surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic to characterize observed resilience for several countries (USA, Brazil, India, Sweden, New Zealand, and Israel) as measured by pandemic impacts across a variety of social, economic, and political domains. We also assess how observed responses and outcomes (i.e., resilience) of the COVID-19 pandemic are associated with pre-pandemic characteristics or vulnerabilities, including (1) prior risk for adverse pandemic outcomes due to population density and age and (2) the systems in place prior to the pandemic that may impact the ability to respond to the crisis, including health infrastructure and economic capacity. Our work demonstrates the importance of viewing vulnerability and resilience in a multi-dimensional way, where a country’s resources and outcomes related to vulnerability and resilience can differ dramatically across economic, political, and social domains. This work also highlights key gaps in our current understanding about vulnerability and resilience and a need for data-driven, context-specific assessments of disaster vulnerability in the future.},

	abstract = {Species introductions are common in freshwater environments and have the potential to transform community and ecosystem structure. Predatory centrarchid fishes and American Bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus Shaw, 1802 previously Rana catesbeiana) are both widespread aquatic invaders implicated in native amphibian declines. In lowland ecosystems, co-occurrence between native and nonnative amphibian and fish taxa is common; however, the mechanisms that facilitate their co-occurrence are poorly studied. Stable isotope analysis offers a tool to examine trophic interactions among native and nonnative taxa, including predation, competition, and shifting food resource availability, which may provide mechanistic insight into the drivers of co-occurrence. In this study, we used stable isotopes (δ13C and δ15N) to determine how the trophic structure of native fishes and amphibians differs between waterbodies with and without nonnative centrarchid fishes and bullfrogs across a floodplain in southwestern Washington, USA. We hypothesized that native species alter their feeding strategies to reduce niche overlap with nonnative taxa. In the presence of nonnative taxa, Three-spine Stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus Linnaeus, 1758), all native larval salamander species (Ambystoma gracile Baird, 1859 and Ambystoma macrodactylum Baird, 1850), and 1 of 2 native larval frog species (Rana aurora Baird and Girard, 1852) exhibited shifts in food resources or trophic position. Despite trophic differences, only 1 species (A. macrodactylum) had a smaller niche size in the presence of nonnatives. The observed trophic shifts reflect changes in habitat or food resources, which may reduce competition or predation and promote co-occurrence between nonnative and native taxa. Our results suggest that the co-occurrence of native and nonnative amphibians and fishes in lowland floodplain habitats may be facilitated by a broad range of food resources and complex habitat structure.},

We explored this concept by analyzing the correlations between climate and West Nile virus (WNV) case data aggregated to geopolitical and ecological regions. We compared correlations between minimum, maximum, and mean annual temperature; precipitation; and annual WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND) case data from 2005 to 2019 when partitioned into (a) climate regions defined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and (b) Level I ecoregions defined by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We found that correlations between climate and WNND in NOAA climate regions and EPA ecoregions were often contradictory in both direction and magnitude, with EPA ecoregions more often supporting previously established biological hypotheses and environmental dynamics underlying vector-borne disease transmission. Using ecological regions to examine the relationships between climate and disease cases can enhance the predictive power of forecasts at various scales, motivating a conceptual shift in large-scale analyses from geopolitical frameworks to more ecologically meaningful regions.},

	abstract = {Background: A healthful diet in early childhood is essential for healthy growth and disease prevention. Parents influence children’s diets through supportive (eg, structure and autonomy support) and unsupportive (eg, coercive control and indulgence) food parenting practices. Historically, much of this work has focused on parents’ “usual” feeding behaviors using survey methods. However, recent studies using ecological momentary assessment methods have allowed assessment of food parenting behaviors in “real time.” This work has revealed that the practices used by parents to feed children vary across contexts and are influenced by factors such as stress or time constraints. Research is needed to understand the dynamic nature of food parenting and its impact on children’s diets.
Objective: This study aimed to describe the methods and procedures used in the Preschool Plates cohort study, which aimed to (1) describe within- and between-day fluctuations in food parenting practices across time and context, (2) examine the longitudinal impact of within- and between-day fluctuations in food parenting practices on child dietary intake, and (3) identify momentary predictors of within- and between-day fluctuations in food parenting practices across time and context.
Methods: Preschool Plates is a longitudinal cohort study examining the impact of food parenting practices on the dietary intake of 3- to 5-year-old children. A total of 273 parent-preschooler dyads consented and enrolled, and 254 (93\%) dyads completed baseline data collection. Dyads will be followed for 2 years using state-of-the-art measures, including an 8-day ecological momentary assessment protocol to assess food parenting, contemporary measures of food parenting, and 3 interview-led 24-hour dietary recalls, collected at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. Child height and weight will be measured at 3 time points.
Results: Recruitment for our baseline sample (N=254) occurred between October 2023 and September 2024. Participants will complete follow-up data collection after 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. A racially and ethnically diverse cohort was enrolled, with 28.3\% (72/254) of enrolled participants identifying as White and 71.7\% (182/254) identifying as non-White.
Conclusions: Findings from the proposed study will inform the development of anticipatory guidance for feeding young children and randomized controlled trials designed to intervene on parents’ responses to momentary factors to encourage interactions with children around feeding that promote optimal diet quality. For example, findings could inform the development of an ecological momentary (ie, real time) intervention that delivers content to participants’ mobile devices in response to real-time assessments of context and circumstance.},

Despite the potential utility of this data, there has been limited development of analysis methods for sequences of daily activities. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering method and cluster evaluation metric for human activity data that leverages an adjacency matrix representation to cluster the data without the calculation of a distance matrix. Our technique is substantially faster than conventional methods based on computing pairwise distances via sequence alignment algorithms and also enhances interpretability of results. We compare our method to distance-based hierarchical clustering and nTreeClus through simulation studies and an application to data collected by Daynamica, an app that turns sensor data into a daily summary of a user’s activities. Among days that contain a large portion of time spent at home, our method distinguishes days that also contain multiple hours of travel or other activities, while both comparison methods fail to identify these patterns. We further identify which day patterns classified by our method are associated with higher concern for contracting COVID-19 with implications for public health messaging.},
